## Purpose:
This analysis was created to help convince prospective investors to invest in our new bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa. Our experiences with the Citi Bike bike sharing program in New York City has us convinced a similar business can work here in our town of Des Moines. A series of data visualizations have been created to detail key facts and usage characteristics of NYC's program. It is hoped the story created from these visuals convinces investors that our business proposal is worth their investment.

## Results:

### Ridership Demographics:
![Demographics](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Demographics.PNG)
- **Total Ridership**: In August 2019 alone, some 2.34 million rides were rented in NYC through the Citi Bike bike sharing program. Of course, NYC is much bigger than Des Moines, but even scaling down for population still shows that we could expect to attract thousands of rides per month in the good weather summer months. 
- **Subscribers vs short-term customers**: As shown above, 81% of the ridership was from annual subscribers of the NYC Citi Bike program. This means our program in Des Moines should create a similar subscription plan to capture a loyal customer base who will use our bikes frequently. An attractive membership program will be key to driving long-term revenue growth and stabilization of monthly revenues.  
- **Gender Breakdown**: Around 65% of NYC's ridership was male. This combined with the high level of subscribers means there is significant demand from men who use bike rentals as a regular part of their lives. Any marketing campaign in Des Moines should seek to target this key demographic.



### Types of Trips:
![Checkout_times](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Checkout_times.PNG)
- **Checkout Times**: As seen above, the vast majority of bikes are checked out for rides lasting no longer than thirty minutes. In fact, the peak appears to be slightly shorter than 10 minutes. As such, it appears most riders are using rental bikes as means to get from one place to another nearby. Whether to avoid the hastle of driving or because it's quicker than walking, the benefits of travel by bike would a core of any marketing push.


![Checkout_times_gender](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Checkout_times_gender.PNG)
- **Checkout Times by Gender**: Breaking out checkout times by gender does not highlight any real difference between males and females. The vast majority of both take short trips. However, trend of ride times is a little different for riders with with no gender listed (unknown). The majority of their rides are still short (30 minutes or less), but the dropoff isn't as pronounced. These uknown-gender customers are more likely to be short-term users and so they might be using rentals more for leisure or not be moving as quickly during their rides as an experienced subscriber might.


### When Trips Occur:
![Weekday_by_hr](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Weekday_by_hr.PNG)
- **Trips by Weekday per Hour**: To begin, most bike rental trips occur during the daylight hours, which follows common sense. From Monday to Friday, the times of highest usage are during the morning (8 to 9am) and evening (5 to 7pm) commute hours. This indicates many riders are using the bikes as part of their commutes to and from work. On weekends, usage is lower and more spread out from the mid-morning hours to early evening. This means that much of NYC's ridership is likely working a more traditional Mon-Friday workweek and using weekend rentals for other miscellaneous uses. 

![Weekday_by_hr_gender](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Weekday_by_hr_gender.PNG)
- **Trips by Gender for each Weekday per Hour**: Both males and females use bikes more frequently during the workweek (Mon-Fri) morning and evening commute hours. Both appear to use bikes somewhat more during evening commutes than the mornings. During the weekends, both genders again follow similiar trends with mid-day around noon being the most popular weekend times for rentals. For customers of unknown gender, more ridership appears on weekends indicating these are more leisure types, perhaps tourists, who are not subscribers, and don't want to give out their gender information.

![Weekday_usertype_gender](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Weekday_usertype_gender.PNG)
- **Trips by Usertype and Gender by Weekday**: The main point gleaned from the figure above is that male subscriber usage from Monday to Friday is the largest driver of NYC's Citi Bike business. Beyond this key point, Thursday was the busiest usage day for annual subscribers (male and female) and Saturday the busiest for short-term customers. Also of interest is that Wednesday is the least busiest day of the week, for all genders and customer types.

### Where Trips Occur:
![Locations](https://github.com/bfox87/bikesharing/blob/main/Visualizations/Locations.PNG)
- **Top Start/Stop Locations**: In NYC, most trips center on Manhattan, the most densely populated area of New York. Within Manhattan the concentration is even more pronounced in midtown Manhattan, which is the main business district in the bourough. 

## Summary:
The analysis of New York's bike sharing program have given us the insights to successfully develop a similiar program here in Des Moines. NYC's experience shows an attractive subscription model will attract the core part of the customer base who will use the bikes in their day work lives. Of course, bikes must be placed in densely populated areas with business activity so these commuters can take advantage. Although males are likely to be users, females will follow similar usage patterns. Although more attention must be paid to developing annual subscribers, short-term users cannot be neglected, particularly in areas that see a lot of activity over weekends.

#### Additional Visualizations for Future Analysis:
A start/stop map by customer type is suggested. So one map sized and colored by usage for just suscriber users, and another map just for short-term customers. This way we can determine if the customer or short-term users are focused more around tourist or recreational areas like parks. Likewise, the subscriber users focused in the main business districts specifically.
**Additionally**, it is important to visualize usage by month if possible. The location of a dataset for a colder weather month is important to calculate how much the NYC business fell off during the winter months. This will allow us to estimate the seasonality impact to our business in Des Moines. **Finally**, mapping of population density and commercial/business activity within Des Moines needs to occur. The demand will focus in these areas so it is important we determine where those are with great accuracy.
